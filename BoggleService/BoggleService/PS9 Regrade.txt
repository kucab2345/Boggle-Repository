PS9 Regrade request

For the changes that we have done to fix the errors in PS9 were:

Add a check to see if there are any games whatsoever going on when the check is going on in cancel game

Checked to see if there was a player in a pending game at all

Altered checks to look against actual word lists instead of incorrect list of players
